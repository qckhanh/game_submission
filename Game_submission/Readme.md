# 🌍 EcoCity Challenge - Climate Change & Sustainability Game

## 📖 Overview

**EcoCity Challenge** is an educational web-based game that addresses climate change and sustainability through engaging gameplay. Players take on the role of a city manager who must balance carbon emissions, budget, and citizen happiness over 10 years of decision-making.

The game highlights the real-world challenges of implementing sustainable policies while maintaining economic viability and public support - a critical issue facing cities worldwide, particularly in rapidly developing regions like Vietnam and Australia.

## 🎮 Game Description

### Theme: Climate Change & Sustainability

Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges of our time. This game educates players about:
- The impact of energy choices on carbon emissions
- Trade-offs between economic growth and environmental protection
- The importance of sustainable transportation, waste management, and industry
- How individual decisions compound over time to create systemic change

### Gameplay Mechanics

- **Turn-Based Strategy**: Each turn represents one year
- **Four Decision Categories**: Energy, Transport, Waste, and Industry
- **Resource Management**: Balance three key metrics:
    - 🌱 **Carbon Emissions**: Keep below 100 to prevent climate disaster
    - 💰 **Budget**: Maintain financial sustainability
    - 😊 **Happiness**: Keep citizens satisfied with your policies
- **Random Events**: Face unexpected challenges like extreme weather, protests, and technological breakthroughs
- **Multiple Endings**: Your choices determine the city's fate
