Prompt 7: Bug Fix - Resource Bar Colors
----------------------------------------
"The carbon resource bar stays green even when carbon is dangerously high. How do I make it
change color based on the value?"

Response: Implemented dynamic coloring:
- Added conditional logic in updateUI()
- Red gradient for carbon > 100
- Orange gradient for carbon > 70
- Green gradient for carbon <= 70
- Applied directly to bar element style

Prompt 8: User Feedback Enhancement
