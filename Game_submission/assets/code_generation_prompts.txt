CODE GENERATION PROMPTS - EcoCity Challenge Game
=================================================

- CSS reset and base styles
- Screen management system
- Component-based styling
- Animation keyframes
- Responsive media queries
- Hover and transition effects
- Color-coded resource indicators

Prompt 3: Game State Management
--------------------------------

decisions made, and settings. Include functions to initialize, update, and reset the state."

Response: Implemented gameState object with:
- All resource values
- Year counter and max years
- Decision history array
- Sound settings
- Current category tracker
- Helper functions for state management

Prompt 4: Decision Database
---------------------------
"Create a comprehensive database of decisions for all 4 categories (Energy, Transport, Waste,
Industry). Each decision should have a title, description, and 4 choices with realistic effects
on carbon, budget, and happiness."

Response: Generated decisions object with:
- 2 decisions per category (8 total)
- 4 choices per decision (32 total choices)
- Balanced effect values
- Descriptive text for each option
- Realistic trade-offs based on real policies

Prompt 5: Random Event System
------------------------------
"Implement a random event system that has a 30% chance of triggering after each decision.
Events should have varying probabilities and effects. Include functions to check, trigger,
and display events."

Response: Created randomEvents array and functions:
- 6 different event types
- Individual probability values
- triggerRandomEvent() function
- showEvent() and hideEvent() UI functions
- Delayed effect application
- Sound effect integration

Prompt 6: UI Update Functions
------------------------------
"Write functions to update all UI elements: resource bars, year counter, decision cards,
and city visualization. Updates should be smooth and provide visual feedback."

Response: Implemented update functions:
- updateUI() master function
- updateResourceBar() with percentage calculation
- Dynamic color changes based on values
- presentDecision() for card generation
- formatEffect() for effect display
- generateCity() for building creation

Prompt 7: Sound System
----------------------
"Create a simple sound system using Web Audio API that doesn't require audio files. Generate
different tones for: button clicks, success, warnings, and game over. Include a toggle function."

Response: Implemented audio system with:
- AudioContext initialization
- playSound() function with type parameter
- Oscillator-based tone generation
- Different frequencies for different events
- Volume and duration control
- toggleSound() function
- Sound enabled state tracking

Prompt 8: Game Flow Logic
-------------------------
"Implement the core game loop: start game, present decision, apply effects, check for events,
advance turn, check win/lose conditions, and end game. Include all transition logic."

Response: Created game flow functions:
- startGame() initialization
- makeDecision() choice handler
- nextTurn() advancement
- endGame() with reason parameter
- Win/lose condition checking
- Score calculation
- Screen transitions

Prompt 9: Results Screen Logic
-------------------------------
"Create the end game logic that calculates score, determines outcome message, generates impact
summary, and displays everything on the results screen. Include multiple ending scenarios."

Response: Implemented endGame() with:
- Score calculation from all resources
- 5 different ending scenarios
- Dynamic title and message generation
- Impact summary generation
- Statistics display
- Rating system (Excellent/Good/Average/Failed)

Prompt 10: Screen Navigation
----------------------------
"Write functions to handle navigation between screens with smooth transitions. Include:
showScreen(), showInstructions(), backToMenu(), pauseGame()."

Response: Created navigation system:
- showScreen() with class toggling
- Screen fade-in animations
- Sound effects on navigation
- Pause confirmation dialog
- Back button handlers
- Active screen management

Prompt 11: Dynamic Content Generation
--------------------------------------
"Implement functions to dynamically generate: decision choice buttons, city buildings,
climate facts rotation, and impact summary items."

Response: Created generation functions:
- presentDecision() for choice buttons
- generateCity() for building elements
- displayRandomFact() with rotation
- Impact list generation in endGame()
- Dynamic HTML creation with innerHTML
- Event listeners attachment

Prompt 12: Resource Clamping and Validation
--------------------------------------------
"Add validation to ensure resource values stay within valid ranges: carbon >= 0, budget >= 0,
happiness between 0-100. Include checks after every decision and event."

Response: Implemented clamping logic:
- Math.max() for minimum values
- Math.min() for maximum values
- Applied in makeDecision()
- Applied in triggerRandomEvent()
- Prevents impossible game states

Prompt 13: Mobile Touch Optimization
-------------------------------------
"Optimize the JavaScript for mobile devices. Ensure touch events work properly, prevent
double-tap zoom on buttons, and handle orientation changes."

Response: Added mobile optimizations:
- Touch-friendly button sizes in CSS
- Viewport meta tag configuration
- Event listeners work with touch
- Responsive layout adjustments
- No special touch event handling needed (click works)

Prompt 14: Local Storage Integration
-------------------------------------
"Add functionality to save sound preferences to localStorage so the setting persists between
sessions."

Response: Implemented storage functions:
- Save sound setting on toggle
- Load setting on page load
- localStorage.setItem() and getItem()
- Fallback for browsers without localStorage
- Setting persistence across sessions

Prompt 15: Performance Optimization
------------------------------------
"Review the code for performance issues. Optimize animations, reduce DOM manipulation, and
ensure smooth gameplay even on slower devices."

Response: Applied optimizations:
- CSS transitions instead of JS animations
- Batch DOM updates in updateUI()
- Minimal reflows and repaints
- Efficient selector usage
- Debounced event handlers where needed
- Lightweight vanilla JS (no frameworks)
