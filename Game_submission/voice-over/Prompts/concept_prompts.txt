CONCEPT PROMPTS - EcoCity Challenge Game
========================================

Prompt 1: Initial Game Concept
-------------------------------
"I need to create a web-based game about climate change and sustainability for a hackathon.
The game should be educational, engaging, and highlight real-world challenges. It needs to be
a simple format like a board game or card game that works in a browser. The target audience
is students and young adults in Vietnam or Australia. Can you suggest game concepts that would
be both fun to play and impactful in raising awareness about climate issues?"

Response: Generated multiple concepts including city management, carbon footprint tracker,
and resource allocation games. Selected city management as most engaging.

Prompt 2: Game Mechanics Design
--------------------------------
"Let's develop a city management game where players make decisions about energy, transport,
waste, and industry over 10 years. The player needs to balance three resources: carbon emissions,
budget, and citizen happiness. Can you help design the core gameplay loop and decision structure?
What kinds of choices should players face, and how should they affect the three resources?"

Response: Designed turn-based system with 4 categories, multiple choices per decision, and
trade-offs between resources. Suggested random events for unpredictability.

Prompt 3: Educational Content Integration
------------------------------------------
"The game needs to be educational. What real climate change facts should I include? And how
can I make the decision choices reflect real-world policy dilemmas that cities face when trying
to become more sustainable? I want players to understand the complexity of climate action."

Response: Provided climate facts from IPCC reports, suggested realistic policy scenarios like
coal vs. renewable energy, public transport expansion, waste management systems, and industrial
regulations with accurate trade-offs.

Prompt 4: Win/Lose Conditions
------------------------------
"What should be the winning and losing conditions? I want multiple possible endings based on
player performance. How should I calculate the final score to reflect both environmental and
social success?"

Response: Designed multi-criteria evaluation system with carbon threshold, budget survival,
happiness minimum, and composite scoring. Created 5 different ending scenarios from "Climate
Hero" to "Bankruptcy" based on final state.

Prompt 5: Game Balance
----------------------
"How do I balance the game so it's challenging but not impossible? Players should feel the
tension between short-term costs and long-term benefits. What should be the starting values
and typical effect ranges for decisions?"

Response: Suggested starting values (Carbon: 50, Budget: 100, Happiness: 75) and effect ranges
(-25 to +15 for various decisions) to create meaningful choices without making the game too
easy or frustratingly difficult.

Prompt 6: Random Events System
-------------------------------
"I want to add random events that can happen during gameplay to make it more dynamic and
realistic. What kinds of climate-related or policy-related events should occur, and how
often should they happen?"

Response: Designed 6 different random events (extreme weather, tech breakthroughs, protests,
funding, factory closures, weather boosts) with probability system (8-15% per event) and
varied impacts on all three resources.

Prompt 7: User Experience Flow
-------------------------------
"What screens should the game have, and how should players navigate between them? I need a
menu screen, gameplay screen, and results screen at minimum. What should each screen contain?"

Response: Designed 4-screen structure: Menu (with climate facts and options), Instructions
(tutorial), Game (with resources, city view, and decision cards), and Results (with score,
statistics, and impact summary).

Prompt 8: Visual Theme Direction
---------------------------------
"I want a minimalist but colorful design. What color schemes and visual elements would work
well for a climate game? It should feel modern and optimistic, not doom-and-gloom."

Response: Suggested gradient backgrounds (purple/blue), green for positive environmental
actions, clean white cards, emoji icons for quick recognition, and smooth animations for
professional feel. Recommended avoiding dark/apocalyptic themes in favor of hopeful aesthetics.
